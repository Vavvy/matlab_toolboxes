% # This toolbox, respectively the function
% <matlab:doc('setup_tool/getallsubfolders') getAllSubfolders>, depends on
% the text file |InPath.txt|. So in each folder which should be inside the
% MATLAB's path you have to add this file. 
% # If you use the toolbox_creator to create your toolbox you should not
% have a problem with this toolbox.
% # This should be the first toolbox to be installed!
