% # This toolbox contains a couple of functions for In- and Output to the
% file system. The most important methods are the functions
% <matlab:doc('io_tool/cell2file') io_tool/cell2file> and
% <matlab:doc('io_tool/file2cell') io_tool/file2cell> which are quite
% useful when you want to edit or read text files. 
% # A couple of functions lets you browse for files and folders. To these
% functions belongs <matlab:doc('io_tool/getallfiles') io_tool/getAllFiles>
% and the functions below. 
% # The toolbox <matlab:doc('setup_tool') setup_tool> contains three files
% which actually belong to this toolbox, but as they are needed there, they
% are only in that toolbox. These files are:
%
% * <matlab:doc('setup_tool/fdir') setup_tool/fdir>
% * <matlab:doc('setup_tool/rdir') setup_tool/rdir>
% * <matlab:doc('setup_tool/getallsubfolders') setup_tool/getAllSubfolders>
