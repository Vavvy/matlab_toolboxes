%% 
% This toolbox is splitted into three parts, which are visualized below. 
%
%% Math
% Contains some mathematical methods, which could be useful in general.
% Just have a look at them, maybe some of them are of help. 
%
%% Constrained Set of Points
% # Using the class <matlab:doc('numerics_tool/consetofpoints')
% numerics_tool/numerics.conSetOfPoints> you can create a set of points
% which satisfy all sorts of constraints in a n-dimensional space. The
% points basically are distributed using latin hypercube sampling and then
% are changed to satisfy (non-)linear (in-)equality constraints. Just have
% a look at the huge amount of examples in
% <matlab:doc('numerics_tool/consetofpoints') 
% numerics_tool/numerics.conSetOfPoints>.
%
%% Constrained Random Matrix
% # Using the class <matlab:doc('numerics_tool/conrandmatrix')
% numerics_tool/numerics.conRandMatrix> you can create a set of points
% which satisfy all sorts of constraints in a n-dimensional space. The
% points basically are distributed using latin hypercube sampling and then
% are changed to satisfy (non-)linear (in-)equality constraints. Just have
% a look at the huge amount of examples in
% <matlab:doc('numerics_tool/conrandmatrix') 
% numerics_tool/numerics.conRandMatrix>. In contrast to
% <matlab:doc('numerics_tool/consetofpoints') 
% numerics_tool/numerics.conSetOfPoints> you can also define a different
% distribution. For example you could try to maximize the distance between
% the points, which is equal between all points at the same time, such that
% the available volume is filled optimally with the points available.
