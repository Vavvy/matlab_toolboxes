%% Introduction
% This toolbox contains scripts used inside the <matlab:doc('biogas')
% biogas> toolbox. 
%
%% Files
% Some functions that have to do with file in-/output. Those are files that
% are needed by a biogas plant model. 
%
%% Is
% Functions that check a function argument, if this argument is a certain
% object. These functions are used internally.
%
%% Model
% Some functions that have to do with a model of a biogas plant. E.g. load
% and close the model. 
%
%% Models
% Next to the ADM1 model further, simpler, models are implemented in this
% toolbox. They are:
%
% * AM1 (Bernard et al., 2001)
% * An extension of AM1 with 6 ODEs (Marsili-Libelli & Beni, 1996)
