%% Introduction
% This toolbox contains methods that can be used to control the substrate
% feed of biogas plants. They are:
%
%% Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
% To control the substrate feed of biogas plants using nonlinear model
% predictive control (NMPC) first have a look at <matlab:doc('startnmpc')
% startNMPC>. As model the Anaerobic DIgestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) is used.
% As optimization methods different global stochastic methods can be used.
% Multi-objective as well as single-objective. 
%
%% Reinforcement Learning
% All scripts have to be checked. Not yet working!
