%% Instructions/Guidelines to use the Toolbox
%
% # If you want to use this toolbox, you also have to use
% <matlab:doc('setup_tool') setup_tool>, <matlab:doc('gecoc_tool_def')
% gecoc_tool_def> and <matlab:doc('doc_tool') doc_tool>. So please install
% them before you install this toolbox, doc_tool also may be installed
% afterwards. Many scripts also use <matlab:doc('script_collection')
% script_collection> and a few <matlab:doc('ml_tool') ml_tool>, thus it is
% advised to install them as well, especially the first.
