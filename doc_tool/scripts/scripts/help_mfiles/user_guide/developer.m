%% 
% If you want to use this toolbox in one of our toolboxes, then you have
% to pay attention to a few restrictions:
%
%%
% # script file:
% - it must contain a short description of the function in the
% beginning of the file
% - it must contain a release cell, e.g.: '%% Release: 1.9'
%
% # doc file:
% - each m-file should have a correspinding doc file, which is for the file
% 'test.m' -> 'test_doc.m'. The doc file contains the documentation of the
% script file. For examples just have a look inside the various toolboxes.
